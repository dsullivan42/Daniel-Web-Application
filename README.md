For this assignment, I created the beginning of the Resume I will continue to be constructing through this semester. I first created the framework in HTML for the header and banner beneath the header. I then formatted it in CSS, because it was the one part that was confusing me while looking at the intial gif given. Afterwords, I finished the framework for the body. Going back and forth a couple of times on how I wanted to format the containers, as well as ensuring that the links got to the desired pathways. After finishing the framework in HTML, I moved to the CSS portion, where I tried my best to format things similarly to the example given. I didn't know exactly how to format the "works" section, but I tried my best to do it and make it look presentable. All links worked when I trialed them after completing the code.
